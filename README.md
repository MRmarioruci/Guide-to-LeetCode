# Guide-to-LeetCode: A Personal Guide to the Most Common and Useful Patterns for Solving Algorithm Questions

Are you tired of struggling with algorithm questions on LeetCode? As someone (with 5+ years of experience) who has started practicing and studying these problems, I can relate to the frustration of not knowing where to start or how to approach a particularly tricky question. After much trial and error, I have come up with a personal guide to the most common and useful patterns for solving algorithm questions, which I hope can help others navigate this challenging terrain.

For each pattern I have listed 10 LeetCode questions to practice on and the list is sorted by learning curve.
